# PDF Statement tools

I like to collect and archive my statements and bills.   This is hard to do.
My office is full of years of hard copies.  If it was easier to gather online
statements, then I might consider abandoning hard copies.

This repo will maybe be some tools to make collecting and organizing easier.

# Why does digital documentation suck so bad?

Online statements from utilities, banks, and brokers are cumbersome.   They
charge you fees to keep sending paper statements, but do nothing to make
collecting online statements convenient.

- They make history search and statement download pages complicated.  Sometimes
  too javascripty so you can't even just get the links to download.
- The filenames presented in the browser are not speficied at all, or are too
  generic to download more than one at a time and keep track of them without
  renaming individually.
- The history is only kept for a fixed time.  10yrs is the longest i've seen,
  but often just 2 yrs or 1 yr. So downloading periodically is a requirement.
  Further, they so often upgrade or change systems, that the risk of missing
  data is much higher than just a matter of expiration


# FileThis is gone

https://filethis.com/

FileThis used to be a paid service that could login to all your online
services, locate and download statements, and save them with sensibles names in
folders in your choice of storage platform, like dropbox.

As of Oct 2023, FileThis went out of business.  It was somewhat unreliable at
times, but that's understandable considering the hundreds of sites they tried to
scrape and how fragile scraping is itself.
